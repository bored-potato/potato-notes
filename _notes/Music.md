I like to go on [the composer subreddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/composer) every so often and see what's there, and so here's a list of  the interesting ones I've found there:

* [Symphony No 2 in C minor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh85AF1C2_M&list=OLAK5uy_ks713LemEaCCN3IXkQZ2pQzX3oklt0kVA&index=1) by G Brown (I'm not entirely sure why the first movement is split into 2 segments with a second of silence in there - kind of breaks the flow for me, not to mention the ad YouTube sticks at the start of the second half...)
