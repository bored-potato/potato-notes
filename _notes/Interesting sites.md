title: Interesting sites
---

Just some of the websites I've found that are useful or fun - kind of a like a very public bookmark list. 

### Buses Related

* [Live London bus map](https://traintimes.org.uk/map/london-buses/) - does what it says on the tin really: shows a map with live positions of the buses that are on the route. 

### GB train websites

* [Traksy](https://traksy.uk/live) can bring up a live map of the trains on a track diagram, with headcode and timetable info. (I like looking at it every so often when I'm a little bit bored at work ðŸ˜‹)
* [OpenTrainTimes's real time track maps](https://www.opentraintimes.com/maps) are also pretty good as well (but its train search function on the homepage confuses me every time I try to use it)
* [Real Time Trains](https://www.realtimetrains.co.uk/) is what I end up using if I need to look up for a specific train. 

### Cantonese Grammar Learning Sites
Right, this one is kinda for my research purpose really. I had a very brief stunt teaching little kids [[Cantonese]] in the UK and during that time I've noticed that whilst there are plenty of resources for teaching Chinese this isn't the case for Cantonese. Here's a list of some interesting sites:

* I haven't tried [CantoneseClass101](https://www.cantoneseclass101.com/)'s course at lall but there are quite a few phrase lists that are accessible even without signing up for their course thing.
* This [Learn Cantonese](https://sites.google.com/site/learncanto/) site has some brief notes on various grammatical aspects of Cantonese; unfortunately it's last updated in 2013. 
* I've found [this Learn101 site](http://learn101.org/cantonese.php) off Google. Looks quite good but I've found many instances where the audio example that goes with the written example sentence isn't 100% saying what is written down.
* There's also [The Art of Hong Kongese by a Dummy](https://www.theartofhongkongesebyadummy.com/hk-grammar) which has a series of blog posts on Cantonese grammar amongst other HK-related stuff by a HKer living in Canada. 
* [Cantolounge](https://cantolounge.com/blog/) also has a bunch of blog posts on Cantonese grammar but the last blog post was back in 2018.
