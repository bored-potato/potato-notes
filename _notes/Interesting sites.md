title: Interesting sites

Just some of the websites I've found that are useful or fun - kind of a like a very public bookmark list. 

### Buses Related

* [Live London bus map](https://traintimes.org.uk/map/london-buses/) - does what it says on the tin really: shows a map with live positions of the buses that are on the route. 

### GB train websites

* [Traksy](https://traksy.uk/live) can bring up a live map of the trains on a track diagram, with headcode and timetable info. (I like looking at it every so often when I'm a little bit bored at work ðŸ˜‹)
* [OpenTrainTimes's real time track maps](https://www.opentraintimes.com/maps) are also pretty good as well (but its train search function on the homepage confuses me every time I try to use it)
* [Real Time Trains](https://www.realtimetrains.co.uk/) is what I end up using if I need to look up for a specific train.
