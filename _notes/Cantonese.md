title: Cantonese

Cantonese is my mother tongue, but because I've spent way too much time away in boarding schools and living abroad my Cantonese skills ain't the greatest. But after a brief time teaching little kids in the UK I've realised there ain't that much resource on teaching Cantonese on the internet. 

So it's kind of a to-do list item for me to put together a somewhat useful grammatical guide/wiki for Cantonese. Bit of an ask for someone who isn't even that great at the language, not to mention with no lingustic background. So good luck I guess?

After looking on Google for a bit the best reference book out there on Cantonese grammar is  [Cantonese:  A Comprehensive Grammar](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/lin/cbrc/CantoneseGrammar/).
